There are two types you will work with in the cross platform code to build the XF app:
        The Application class
        The Pages

The Application class is the cross platform entry point to the application.
It is located/found and used by the platform specific code to initialize the application.
The project template will always create a derived class from Application type.
It will point to the first page of the application.

The Pages is used to display single screen to the user.
It defines the UI in code or markup and provides behaviour for the screen
The application class will identify starting page through a property. (MainPage)

Events which are raised as navigation happens in application.

App class can override the lifecycle methods that are derived from Application class.
There are three methods:
    OnStart()
    OnSleep()
    OnResume()

OnStart - When the app is launched and it was not running.
          Use it to load data from persistent storage,hit webservice to cache off data

OnSleep - Called when app was active and user swithes to another app.
          Can be used to refresh data that is already available on screen.
        
OnResume - ?
