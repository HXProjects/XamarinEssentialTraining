App class creates atleast one page which represent single screen of the app.

A page can contains several control for user interactions - they are called views. Entry,Button label etc are all views.

eg. of a page: ContentPage

ContentPage is a class that holds single piece of content assigned through its property name Content.

MasterDetails class is another page which has two props - Master and Detail

NavigationPage enables the typical stack based navigation with the navigation bar header.
The constructor of this page takes the initial child page to display.
eg: var np = new NavigationPage(new Employee());

Other egs of pages - TabbedPage,CarouselPage

The XF controls are just a model definition. At runtime, each platform will take the object graph that will be created 
and turn it into the native representation. The peice of code that does this RENDERER.
eg: if we create a XF button and set the text property to click me, the iOS Renderer converts this to native iOS UIButton 
control
